# Trade-A-Belay

This MERN Stack project was built based on feedback from my local climbing community.

Our local climbing gym offers a "Trade-A-Belay" white board at the gym. This is where climbers write their name if they are in the gym and looking for a climbing partner. While this simple system works for climbers who are already in the gym, it doesn't work for climbers looking to find a partner before they leave home.

To address this need, I used the MERN Stack to build a virtual Trade-A-Belay board which allows users to create a profile and find other climbers with compatible styles. The board is based on a copy of our local gym's website.
